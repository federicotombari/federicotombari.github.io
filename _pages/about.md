I am a Research Scientist and manager at [Google Zurich](https://research.google/people/FedericoTombari/) (Switzerland), where I lead an applied research team in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. I am also affiliated to the [Faculty of Computer Science](https://www.in.tum.de/startseite/) at TU Munich (Germany) as [lecturer](https://www.in.tum.de/campar/members/senior-research-scientists/federico-tombari/) (Privatdozent). 

An up-to-date list of publications is available at my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=TFsE4BIAAAAJ&hl=en). My research activity has been mostly focused on 3D computer vision, such as 3D scene understanding, 3D object recognition, 3D reconstruction/modeling, SLAM. The fields of application of my research are mainly in robotics, healthcare, augmented reality and autonomous driving. Currently I am particularly excited about unsupervised/self-supervised learning, deep implicit models and scene graphs.
